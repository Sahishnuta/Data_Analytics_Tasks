## Problem Statement

**Analyze Airbnb listing data to extract meaningful business insights that can help:**

1. **Understand market dynamics** across different neighborhoods
2. **Identify pricing patterns** and optimal pricing strategies  
3. **Evaluate host performance** and listing quality
4. **Provide data-driven recommendations** for hosts, travelers, and business stakeholders

### 1. **Market Analysis & Pricing Optimization**
- What are the price distributions across different neighborhoods?
- How do room types affect pricing?
- Which locations offer the best value for money?
- What's the relationship between listing features and pricing?

### 2. **Host Performance & Quality Assessment**
- How do review scores correlate with listing characteristics?

- Which hosts are performing exceptionally well/poorly?
- How does host responsiveness impact guest satisfaction?

### 3. **Availability & Occupancy Patterns**
- How does availability vary throughout the year?
- What are the booking patterns across different seasons?
- Which neighborhoods have the highest/lowest availability?

### 4. **Geospatial Analysis**
- How are listings distributed geographically?
- Are there location-based clusters of high/low performance?
- What's the neighborhood-wise density of Airbnb listings?

## Data Processing Challenges

The code addresses several data quality issues:

1. **Missing Values Handling**
   - Price column cleaning and conversion
   - Review score imputation
   - Geographic coordinate validation

2. **Data Type Conversion**
   - String to numeric conversion for prices
   - Date parsing for temporal analysis
   - Categorical variable encoding

3. **Data Validation**
   - Removing invalid geographic coordinates
   - Handling extreme outliers in pricing
   - Consistency checks across related columns

## Analytical Approach
