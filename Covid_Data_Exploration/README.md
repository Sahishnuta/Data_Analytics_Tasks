## Problem Statement

**Analyze COVID-19 data to understand the pandemic's impact across different countries and identify key trends, patterns, and insights that can inform public health decisions and awareness.**

## Key Objectives:

### 1. **Global Pandemic Assessment**
- Track the worldwide spread of COVID-19 cases and deaths
- Analyze mortality rates and infection trends over time
- Identify countries most severely affected by the pandemic

### 2. **Geographical Analysis**
- Compare COVID-19 impact across different continents and countries
- Identify regional patterns and hotspots
- Analyze population-adjusted infection and death rates

### 3. **Temporal Trends**
- Track the progression of the pandemic over time
- Identify waves and peaks of infections
- Analyze daily new cases and death trends

### 4. **Vaccination Impact Analysis**
- Correlate vaccination rates with case/death trends
- Assess the effectiveness of vaccination campaigns
- Identify countries with successful vaccination strategies

### 5. **Data Quality and Completeness**
- Assess data reliability across different countries
- Identify gaps in reporting and data collection
- Handle missing or inconsistent data

## Technical Approach:

The code appears to use **SQL for data exploration** to:
- Perform aggregations and calculations
- Join multiple COVID-related datasets
- Calculate percentages and rates
- Filter and sort data to identify significant trends
- Create temporary tables for complex analyses

## Expected Outcomes:

1. **Quantitative Insights**: Infection rates, death percentages, vaccination coverage
2. **Comparative Analysis**: Country-to-country and region-to-region comparisons  
3. **Trend Identification**: Peak periods, growth patterns, seasonal variations
4. **Data Quality Assessment**: Reliability of reported figures across regions
5. **Actionable Intelligence**: Insights that could inform future pandemic response strategies

This exploration serves as a **foundational epidemiological analysis** that could support public health decision-making, resource allocation, and pandemic preparedness planning.
